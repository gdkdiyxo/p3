# InternSearch
InternSearch is a free to use website created to help students find jobs and internships that was made for MenloHacks 5.1 and won Best All-Girls Project

## Inspiration
My friends and I have been looking for internships that have to do with our combined interest in STEM. However, we found this process to be extremely tedious as there was no one consolidated place we could go to look for updated listings and opportunities. InternSearch is my attempt at changing that.
## What it does
InternSearch provides employees a platform to promote the opportunities they offer to the younger generation and allows the younger generation to find opportunities they are interested in and connect with various institutions.
## How I built it
I built the site using Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JQuery. Additionally, I used Autodesk Sketchbook to design the logo.
## Challenges I ran into
The biggest challenges for me were thinking of a topic and implementing JQuery. I never used JQuery before and I'm also really new to HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so learning a new framework took a lot of my time.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud of the fact that I was able to make my **first** website ever in a span of fewer than 24 hours while learning new frameworks and expanding my knowledge on HTML, CSS, and Javascript, especially as someone who came into the hackathon with most of my experience being in Java, Python, and C++.
## What I learned
I learned JQuery and became better at time management with my technology-related projects.
## What's next for InternSearch
Next, I plan to implement a more versatile database using SQL or MongoDB to allow InternSearch to have a larger scope for job opportunities it provides.
